# Mtgcarddata
A project using data scraping to get data from mtgdecks.net to gather commander deck data for later analysis and storage. 

This project is inspired, guided, and provided by the YouTuber; Alex the Analyst and his Scaping Data from a Real Website video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dTpNajxaH0&list=LL&index=4&t=171s. 
I am also using replit for my code since it is easier to push my changes through them directly to my repository. 

# Reference Information and Links
This section is made for all the different links to articles and forms and etc. I use for aid and examples on this project. It is another way to detail some documentation for this project.
